CHANGES ON V4.5 BORD ROBIN:
- Scheme divided into several pages
- Motor and valve control deleted
- Interface to tractor according to ISO 11786 added
- No Ampseal connector but several screw terminals
- Longer format so that the PCB has space next to the driver's seat

CHANGES ON V4.5 BOARDS:
- replaced C16133 100uF Tantalum to correct JLCPCB rotation conflict
- replaced green 0603 LEDs with 0805
- added "+" markers on silkscreen for diodes, LEDs, caps to aid with verifying JLCPCB placement

CHANGES ON V4.4 BOARDS:
-changed Q3 and Q9 to similar available parts
- added schottky diodes for WAS inputs
- added solder jumpers for Speed pulse +/- outputs
- replaced as many parts with Basic as possible
- optos, buttons are also SMT so less hand soldering fees
- replaced ext 22uF caps with basic 100uF tantalum
- Added diodes on the Teensy power inputs
- Increased the lock traces to handle 4 amp max continious.

HOW TO ORDER

Order the PCB on JLCPCB.com

if JLCPCB have shortage check in "JLCPCB ALTERNATE PARTS.xlsx" for alternate parts.

check in "OTHER USEFULL PARTS.xlsx" for the complete list or parts need for the board.




Part that you don't have to order (Prices for 5 boards):

If no Danfoss, you don't need: U14 (7 USD), H21 (0.15 USD), H22 (0.15 USD), R43 (0.01 USD)


if no CANBUS, you don't need: U17 (8 USD), D5 (3 USD) 



There is no much to save by removing SpeedPulse and LOCK:

Board's setup
Refer to "board setup.jpg"

If all the parts were available when ordering the board is almost ready to use.
-Install a fuse (Mini ATO blade fuse)

To use a cytron motor controler, solder a wire to the correct power source (orange circles)
From "Pwr" to "12V power for Cytron" for source from the fuse protected input. For battery voltage use.
From "Pwr" to "Pin 18 -Alt Cytron Power" for source from a dedicated input (Ampseal pin 18) For converter or other special use.

For Danfoss put the 2 jumpers marked "Danfoss" and "Danfoss Us"

If using external devices to turn off autosteer, put jumpers in the blue cercled areas
-no need for jumpers when using current sence
-for remote put a jumper on "remote"
-for 0-5v sensor put a jumper on "pressure"
-for 4-20ma sensor put jumpers on "pressure" and "4-20ma"

There are solder Pads for advanced configurations
